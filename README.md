## About

Project concept from [the Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/nodejs/lessons/members-only) curriculum with slight variations to make it more practical.

A sample API mimicking a members only service, it allows members to access only authorized resources. Members get to perform the following operations:

    * Create their profile.
    * Update their profile.
    * Create Posts.
    * Comment on posts by other members.
    * Like posts by other members.
    * A member can only like a post once.
    * Some operations are restricted to admin users only.
